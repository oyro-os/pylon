//! Lease-locked occupancy sweeper (Task D2).
//!
//! A live node re-stamps its members' `expireAt` via the membership heartbeat
//! (`heartbeat_loop`). A node that crashes simply stops ticking — its members'
//! `expireAt` stamps fall into the past and nothing else removes them. The sweeper
//! is the cluster's garbage collector for those orphaned members: exactly one node
//! at a time holds a short-lived Redis lease (`{prefix}:sweeplock`), scans every
//! occupied channel, HDELs members whose `expireAt < now`, and — when that empties a
//! channel — DELs the occ hash, de-indexes the channel, and fires `channel_vacated`
//! (through the dispatcher's grace + cluster re-check, so a re-subscribe within the
//! grace window suppresses the webhook).
//!
//! Every Redis error is logged and skipped; one failure must never abort the whole
//! sweep. Nothing here panics or unwraps.
