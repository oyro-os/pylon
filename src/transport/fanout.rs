//! Per-core SHARDED broadcast fan-out sink (SP9).
//!
//! The legacy delivery path ([`ChannelState::broadcast`](crate::channel::state))
//! enqueues a broadcast onto every subscriber's per-connection `mpsc` mailbox
//! from ONE thread. With N (e.g. 10k) subscribers on a channel that is N
//! `UnboundedSender::send` calls — each an alloc + a futex wake — serialized on
//! the publishing thread, which walls fan-out long before the CPU is the bound.
//!
//! This sink replaces that with a per-WORKER hand-off: a broadcast notifies each
//! worker exactly ONCE (W messages, not N), and each worker then fans the
//! (already WS-framed) bytes out to its OWN local subscribers by direct
//! slab-enqueue (an `Arc` bump per subscriber, no per-connection mpsc, no
//! per-connection wake). The work to actually copy bytes onto each connection's
//! send queue is thereby spread across all worker cores instead of running
//! serially on the publisher.
//!
//! Only DELIVERY of channel broadcasts moves here; membership/counts still flow
//! through the registry, and DIRECT sends (connection_established, rosters,
//! send_to_user, terminate, …) still use the per-connection mailbox.
//!
//! Safe Rust — the crate root sets `#![deny(unsafe_code)]`; this module adds no
//! `unsafe`.
