//! Per-worker timer wheel for connection liveness (SP11 §4).
//!
//! The legacy per-connection task (`connection/task.rs:113-135`) runs a tokio
//! `interval` per socket: after `activity_timeout` seconds of no inbound traffic
//! it sends a `pusher:ping`; if that ping goes unanswered for `pong_timeout`
//! seconds it closes the connection with code `4201`. The per-core transport has
//! no per-connection tokio runtime, so it can't lean on a timer-per-socket.
//!
//! [`TimerWheel`] reproduces those exact semantics with one structure per worker:
//! a [`BTreeMap`] keyed by absolute deadline (monotonic ms since the worker
//! epoch) holding the connection tokens that expire then, plus a side table
//! recording each connection's *current* scheduled deadline and what kind of
//! event it is (idle-ping vs. pong-timeout-close). Lookups by deadline are
//! `O(due-count)` per [`due`](TimerWheel::due) — the wheel only ever visits the
//! entries that have actually expired, never every connection.
//!
//! Rescheduling (a [`touch`](TimerWheel::touch) on inbound activity, or a
//! [`mark_ping_sent`](TimerWheel::mark_ping_sent) after emitting a ping) leaves
//! the old timeline entry in place and is reconciled lazily: when `due` pops a
//! deadline it checks the side table and discards the entry if the connection
//! has since been rescheduled past it. A `touch` arriving while a ping is
//! outstanding therefore *cancels* the pending `4201` close — exactly the legacy
//! `ping_sent_at = None` on inbound activity.
//!
//! Time is injected (every method takes `now_ms`) so the unit test is fully
//! deterministic. The worker feeds it the same monotonic clock it already
//! computes for CoDel (the `worker_epoch` elapsed, in milliseconds).
//!
//! Safe Rust — the crate root sets `#![deny(unsafe_code)]`; this module adds no
//! `unsafe`.
