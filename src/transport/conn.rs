//! Per-connection state and non-blocking I/O for the SP9 per-core transport.
//!
//! A [`Connection`] wraps a single non-blocking [`mio::net::TcpStream`] and owns
//! the two halves of a Pusher WebSocket session:
//!
//! * **Outbound.** A queue of pre-encoded frames ([`Arc<[u8]>`], so a broadcast
//!   payload is encoded once and fanned out as cheap `Arc` clones). [`flush`]
//!   drains the queue with *corked* writes — it coalesces as many queued frames
//!   as the socket will accept in a single call, advancing a cursor across
//!   partial writes, and reports backpressure via [`WriteStatus::WouldBlock`].
//!   [`queue`] enforces a high-water mark so a slow consumer cannot make us
//!   buffer unbounded memory.
//!
//! * **Inbound.** [`read_frames`] reads whatever the socket has available into a
//!   caller-supplied scratch [`BytesMut`] and parses every complete frame out of
//!   it, leaving any partial-frame remainder in the buffer for next time.
//!
//! Every method is non-blocking and 100% safe Rust (the crate root sets
//! `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`). None of them ever loops on `WouldBlock`; the
//! worker re-arms epoll interest and calls back.
