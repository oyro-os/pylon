//! Lean per-core WebSocket transport (SP9).
//!
//! This module owns the raw RFC 6455 frame layer for the new per-connection
//! transport. Unlike `tokio-tungstenite`, it does **not** eagerly allocate a
//! large (128 KiB) read buffer per connection: framing operates over a
//! caller-owned [`bytes::BytesMut`] that grows lazily, and parsed payloads are
//! cheap `Bytes` slices into that buffer.
//!
//! Only [`frame`] is implemented in this phase; the connection state machine
//! that drives it is built in later SP9 phases.
