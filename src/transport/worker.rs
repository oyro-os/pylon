//! Single-worker `mio` event loop for the per-core transport (SP9).
//!
//! [`run`] binds a listener, then drives a non-blocking accept → handshake →
//! frame loop entirely on the calling thread with one [`mio::Poll`]. A
//! [`slab::Slab`] is the connection table: the slab key *is* the connection's
//! [`mio::Token`] value, so a readiness event maps to its [`Connection`] in
//! O(1). The listener uses a reserved token ([`LISTENER`]) that no slab key can
//! collide with.
//!
//! Readiness is managed edge-friendly: a connection is registered
//! `READABLE`-only and only gains `WRITABLE` interest when a [`flush`] returns
//! [`WriteStatus::WouldBlock`]; the interest is dropped back to `READABLE` once
//! the queue drains. This keeps the loop from spinning on a writable socket with
//! nothing to send.
//!
//! Two behaviours are supported:
//!
//! * [`Mode::Echo`] — every inbound data frame is re-encoded and queued straight
//!   back, pings are answered with pongs, a close tears the connection down.
//!   Used by the transport's own unit tests.
//! * [`Mode::Dispatch`] — the real Pusher v7 protocol. On handshake completion
//!   the worker resolves the `/app/{key}` tenant, builds a
//!   [`ConnectionContext`] (mirroring `ws::upgrade`), emits
//!   `pusher:connection_established`, and from then on decodes each inbound Text
//!   frame to a [`ClientCommand`] and drives `ctx.dispatch(..)` via
//!   `block_on`. After every dispatch (and once per loop iteration) every Open
//!   connection's mailbox is drained: queued [`ServerEvent`]s are encoded and
//!   written, so broadcast fan-out reaches its subscribers. This REUSES all
//!   subscribe/presence/client-event/signin logic — it does not reimplement the
//!   protocol.
//!
//! `block_on` is safe here because the [`LocalAdapter`](crate::adapter::local)
//! async methods never await real I/O; they complete synchronously.
//!
//! Safe Rust — the crate root sets `#![deny(unsafe_code)]`; this module adds no
//! `unsafe`.
//!
//! Multiple of these worker loops run in `TransportMode::Percore` (one per CPU),
//! each with its own `SO_REUSEPORT` listener on the same `bind:port`, so the
//! kernel spreads accepts across workers; see [`crate::transport::run_percore`].
