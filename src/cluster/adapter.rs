//! [`ClusterAdapter`]: the worker-side `Adapter` the percore [`crate::transport::worker`]
//! drives via `block_on(ctx.dispatch(..))` when clustering is active.
//!
//! It does the LOCAL half synchronously on an injected [`LocalAdapter`] (which never
//! awaits real I/O) and fires the matching FIRE-AND-FORGET [`ClusterCmd`] at the
//! [`ClusterBridge`] over a [`ClusterHandle`]. It NEVER awaits Redis — that is the whole
//! point of the bridge: the sync mio loop must not block on the network.
//!
//! Division of labour for the membership/broadcast edges:
//! - `subscribe` / `unsubscribe`: the worker keeps the node-LOCAL outcome (count, presence
//!   roster). The bridge, on the node's single `RedisAdapter`, computes the authoritative
//!   cluster count and fires the single cluster-wide `subscription_count` /
//!   `channel_occupied` / `channel_vacated` — which the connection handler suppresses in
//!   cluster mode (`ConnectionContext::clustered`). For PRESENCE channels the worker still
//!   does the node-local join (so the connection is indexed for delivery), but the bridge
//!   owns the cluster-wide outputs: it sends the cluster ROSTER back as
//!   `subscription_succeeded` and fires the single cluster-wide `member_added` /
//!   `member_removed` (`PresenceSubscribe` / `PresenceLeave`).
//! - `broadcast`: local delivery happens here on the worker; the bridge's `Publish` does
//!   ONLY the Redis publish, so there is no double local delivery and self-dedup stops the
//!   origin re-receiving its own frame.
//!
//! Signin/watchlist follow the same split: `signin_user` / `signout_user` / `watch` /
//! `unwatch` do the node-LOCAL half synchronously and fire the cluster edge at the bridge
//! (`Signin` / `Signout` / `Watch` / `Unwatch`), which owns the cluster-wide online
//! refcount, the `WatchOnline` / `WatchOffline` publish (REMOTE watchers) + the LOCAL
//! watcher notify, and the cluster-wide initial online snapshot. `send_to_user` /
//! `terminate_user` are NEVER called on the worker path (they are REST/admin ops driven by
//! the node's `RedisAdapter` via `bridge.adapter()`); the worker methods delegate to
//! `local` only as a non-cluster fallback. Presence CAPACITY enforcement and cache stay
//! node-local per the per-method notes.
