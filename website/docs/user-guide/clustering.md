# Clustering & Scaling

Pylon scales horizontally by connecting multiple nodes through a shared Redis instance.
Each node is stateless from a routing perspective — any node can serve any client.
There is no sticky-session requirement.

---

## How it works

By default, pylon uses the `local` adapter, which holds all connection and channel
state in process memory. This is sufficient for a single node but cannot be shared
across multiple servers.

Switching to the `redis` adapter causes every node to:

- **Publish and subscribe** to a shared Pub/Sub channel so that an event triggered
  on one node is fanned out to connections on all other nodes.
- **Coordinate presence channels** — member joins and leaves are written to Redis so
  that any node can answer a presence query with the full, consistent member list.
- **Route user-targeted operations** — `POST /users/{id}/terminate_connections` finds
  the node(s) holding a specific user's connections via Redis and forwards the
  termination command accordingly.
- **Self-heal across Redis restarts** — nodes monitor the Redis connection and
  reconnect automatically; a brief Redis outage does not crash pylon, it only
  degrades cluster-state consistency until reconnection.

## Enabling the redis adapter

Set these two variables identically on every pylon node:

```env
PYLON_ADAPTER=redis
PYLON_REDIS_URL=redis://your-redis-host:6379
```

All other configuration (bind address, port, `PYLON_APPS_PATH`, …) stays per-node.
The apps list must be **identical** on every node; pylon does not replicate it through Redis.

### Optional Redis knobs

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `PYLON_REDIS_PREFIX` | `pylon` | Key prefix for all pylon Redis keys — change if you share a Redis instance with other services. |
| `PYLON_REDIS_POOL_SIZE` | `6` | Connection-pool size per node. |
| `PYLON_REDIS_MEMBERSHIP_TTL` | `60` | Seconds before a node's membership entry expires if it stops heartbeating. |
| `PYLON_REDIS_NODE_HEARTBEAT` | `5` | Heartbeat interval (seconds) each node publishes to Redis. |
| `PYLON_REDIS_PRESENCE_HEARTBEAT` | `25` | Interval (seconds) at which presence-member entries are refreshed. |
| `PYLON_REDIS_SHARDED_PUBSUB` | `false` | Enable Redis 7+ sharded Pub/Sub for higher-throughput clusters. |

See [Configuration](configuration.md) for the full variable reference.

## Load balancer requirements

Any standard TCP/HTTP load balancer works — pylon does **not** require session affinity.
The only requirements are:

1. **Pass the WebSocket Upgrade through.** The load balancer must forward the
   `Upgrade: websocket` and `Connection: Upgrade` headers unchanged, and must
   not buffer or rewrite the HTTP response. Most modern LBs (HAProxy, nginx,
   AWS ALB, GCP LB) support this out of the box; verify the WebSocket mode is
   enabled in the LB configuration.

2. **Use `/ready` for health checks.** During a rolling update, pylon flips
   `/ready` to `503` before draining connections. Configure the LB to use
   `GET /ready` as its health probe (not `/health`) so that draining nodes stop
   receiving new connections before existing ones are closed.

3. **Long connection timeouts.** The Pusher heartbeat cycle is 120 s; configure
   idle-connection timeouts well above that (3 600 s is a safe default).

## Two-node Docker Compose example

The repository ships a ready-to-run 2-node cluster under `deploy/docker/docker-compose.yml`.
It starts Redis 7, `pylon-1` (host port 7000), and `pylon-2` (host port 7001),
all sharing the same `apps.json` and connected via the redis adapter.

```bash
# 1. Apply host kernel tuning (needed once per Docker host):
cp deploy/systemd/99-pylon.sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d/
sysctl --system

# 2. Create and edit the apps config — change the secret!
cp deploy/systemd/apps.example.json deploy/docker/apps.json

# 3. Build the image and start the cluster.
cd deploy/docker
docker compose up -d --build

# 4. Verify both nodes are healthy.
curl -s http://localhost:7000/health
curl -s http://localhost:7001/health
```

In production, put a load balancer (nginx, HAProxy, or a cloud LB) in front of
the two nodes and route traffic to whichever node responds healthy on `/ready`.

---

## Redis high availability

For production, run Redis with at least one replica and use Redis Sentinel or
Redis Cluster so that a primary failure does not take the cluster state offline.
Pylon reconnects automatically on connection loss, so a Sentinel failover
(typically 10–30 s) results in a brief degradation window rather than a hard outage.

!!! warning "Redis is a coordination plane, not a data plane"
    All WebSocket frames are delivered directly between pylon nodes and their
    connected clients. Redis only coordinates channel state and fan-out routing;
    its throughput requirements are far lower than the WebSocket message rate.
