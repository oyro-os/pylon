# Webhooks

Pylon fires signed HTTP POST requests (webhooks) to your server when specific channel events
occur. Webhooks are configured per-app in `apps.json` and delivered with retry and backoff on
transient failures.

---

## Configuration

Each app in `apps.json` has a `webhooks` array. Each entry specifies a target URL, the event
types to deliver, and optional custom headers:

```json
{
  "webhooks": [
    {
      "url": "https://your-server.example.com/pusher/webhooks",
      "event_types": [
        "channel_occupied",
        "channel_vacated",
        "member_added",
        "member_removed",
        "client_event",
        "cache_miss"
      ],
      "headers": {
        "X-Custom-Token": "secret-value"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `url` | HTTPS (or HTTP) endpoint that will receive the POST. |
| `event_types` | List of event type names to deliver to this endpoint. Omit types you don't need. |
| `headers` | Optional map of extra HTTP headers to include. Cannot override `Content-Type`, `X-Pusher-Key`, or `X-Pusher-Signature`. |

You may define multiple webhook entries per app — each with its own URL and event-type filter.

---

## Event types

Pylon fires six event types:

| Event type | Fired when |
|---|---|
| `channel_occupied` | The first subscriber joins a channel (channel transitions from empty to occupied). |
| `channel_vacated` | The last subscriber leaves a channel (channel becomes empty). A configurable grace period (`PYLON_WEBHOOK_VACATED_GRACE_MS`, default 3 000 ms) delays this event to absorb brief reconnects. |
| `member_added` | A client joins a presence channel (`presence-*`). |
| `member_removed` | A client leaves a presence channel (`presence-*`). |
| `client_event` | A client publishes a `client-` prefixed event (only fired when `client_messages_enabled` is `true` for the app). |
| `cache_miss` | A new subscriber joins a cache channel (`cache-*`, `private-cache-*`, `presence-cache-*`) and no cached event exists for that channel. |

---

## Request format

Pylon batches events that fire within the same `PYLON_WEBHOOK_BATCH_MS` window (default 50 ms) and
sends them in a single POST. The body is a JSON object:

```json
{
  "time_ms": 1700000000000,
  "events": [
    {
      "name": "channel_occupied",
      "channel": "my-channel"
    }
  ]
}
```

The `events` array contains one or more event objects. Their shapes by type:

**`channel_occupied` / `channel_vacated` / `cache_miss`:**
```json
{ "name": "channel_occupied", "channel": "my-channel" }
```

**`member_added` / `member_removed`:**
```json
{ "name": "member_added", "channel": "presence-room", "user_id": "user-42" }
```

**`client_event`:**
```json
{
  "name": "client_event",
  "channel": "private-chat",
  "event": "client-typing",
  "data": { "user": "alice" },
  "socket_id": "123.456",
  "user_id": "user-42"
}
```

`user_id` is only present on `client_event` when the sender is a member of a presence channel;
it is omitted otherwise.

## Verification

Every webhook POST carries two signature headers:

| Header | Value |
|---|---|
| `X-Pusher-Key` | Your app's public key |
| `X-Pusher-Signature` | `HMAC-SHA256(app_secret, raw_body)` as a lowercase hex string |

To verify a webhook:

1. Read the raw request body bytes (do not parse JSON first).
2. Compute `HMAC-SHA256(your_app_secret, raw_body)`.
3. Compare the result (constant-time) to the value of `X-Pusher-Signature`.
4. Reject requests that fail verification.

Example in Node.js:

```js
const crypto = require("crypto");

function verifyWebhook(rawBody, signature, appSecret) {
  const expected = crypto
    .createHmac("sha256", appSecret)
    .update(rawBody)
    .digest("hex");
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(
    Buffer.from(expected, "utf8"),
    Buffer.from(signature, "utf8")
  );
}

// In your Express handler:
app.post("/pusher/webhooks", (req, res) => {
  const sig = req.headers["x-pusher-signature"];
  if (!verifyWebhook(req.rawBody, sig, process.env.PUSHER_APP_SECRET)) {
    return res.status(403).send("Forbidden");
  }
  const payload = JSON.parse(req.rawBody);
  for (const event of payload.events) {
    console.log(event.name, event.channel);
  }
  res.sendStatus(200);
});
```

!!! warning "Use the raw body"
    Parse the body only after verifying the signature. Many frameworks re-serialize JSON
    with different whitespace, which will break the HMAC check.

## Batching and delivery knobs

Pylon coalesces events that arrive within `PYLON_WEBHOOK_BATCH_MS` (default 50 ms) into a single
POST to reduce request overhead. See [Configuration](configuration.md) for the full set of tuning
variables:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `PYLON_WEBHOOK_BATCH_MS` | `50` | Coalescing window in milliseconds |
| `PYLON_WEBHOOK_MAX_CONCURRENCY` | `100` | Maximum simultaneous in-flight deliveries |
| `PYLON_WEBHOOK_MAX_RETRIES` | `3` | Retry attempts on `5xx` or `429` responses |
| `PYLON_WEBHOOK_RETRY_BASE_MS` | `100` | Base delay for exponential backoff |
| `PYLON_WEBHOOK_TIMEOUT_MS` | `5000` | Per-attempt HTTP request timeout |
| `PYLON_WEBHOOK_VACATED_GRACE_MS` | `3000` | Grace period before firing `channel_vacated` |

Delivery failures (permanent `4xx` after retry exhaustion, or transport errors) are counted in
the Prometheus metrics exposed at `/metrics`.
