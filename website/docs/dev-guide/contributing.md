# Contributing

Full contribution guidelines are in
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/oyro-os/pylon/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
in the repository root. This page summarises the key expectations.

## Build and Test Expectations

Before opening a pull request:

1. **Format:** run `cargo fmt --all` and confirm the tree is clean.
2. **Lint:** run `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`. Zero warnings are
   permitted; the CI gate enforces this.
3. **Test:** run `cargo test` (unit + integration). If your change touches the
   cluster or Redis adapter, also run the relevant cluster tests with
   `PYLON_TEST_REDIS_URL` set. Use `--test-threads=1` for deterministic results.
4. **Add or update tests** for any behaviour you change. New behaviour should
   have a failing test first.

See [Building & Testing](building-and-testing.md) for exact commands.

## Pusher Parity Rule

Pylon aims for faithful parity with **hosted Pusher Channels** (protocol v7
and the HTTP API). When behaviour is ambiguous, hosted Pusher's documented
behaviour is the source of truth.

If a change affects wire format, error codes, authentication signatures, or
REST semantics, call that out explicitly in the PR description and reference the
relevant Pusher documentation or observed behaviour.

## Pull Request Process

- Keep changes focused; prefer small, well-scoped commits with clear messages.
- Reference any related issue in the PR description.
- The CI pipeline (fmt → clippy → test) must be green.
