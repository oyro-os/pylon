//! End-to-end 2-node clustered-percore PRESENCE proof (SP11 §3.4a gate).
//!
//! Two REAL percore nodes (each a single-worker `mio` fleet + a [`ClusterBridge`]
//! owning that node's `RedisAdapter`) are spawned on ONE shared Redis key prefix,
//! forming a 2-node cluster. The tests connect real WS presence clients to each
//! node and prove the cluster-wide presence happy path rides through Redis:
//!
//! * `cross_node_presence_roster_is_cluster_wide` — a presence subscribe on node B
//!   sees a `subscription_succeeded` roster that contains BOTH the member on node A
//!   and itself (the bridge's `cluster_presence_join` returns the cluster roster).
//! * `cross_node_presence_member_added_single_emit` — when a presence member joins
//!   on node B, an already-subscribed member on node A receives EXACTLY ONE
//!   `pusher_internal:member_added` (cross-node, single-emit on the cluster
//!   first-for-user edge — never duplicated).
//! * `cross_node_presence_member_removed_single_emit` — when the member on node B
//!   leaves, the member on node A receives EXACTLY ONE `member_removed`.
//!
//! Like `percore_cluster.rs`, these talk to a REAL Redis (`PYLON_TEST_REDIS_URL`,
//! default `redis://127.0.0.1:6390`) and isolate every run behind a random key
//! prefix — they NEVER issue FLUSHALL/FLUSHDB. They FAIL LOUD if Redis is
//! unreachable (the bridge `start` panics with a clear message).
//!
//! Cross-node delivery has Redis pub/sub latency, so every cross-node assertion is
//! BOUNDED by a timeout (the shared WS helpers' built-in per-frame timeout plus an
//! explicit poll loop), never masked by a long unconditional sleep.
